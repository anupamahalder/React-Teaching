# React Teaching
  I will cover the core concepts of React from the begining. The only prerequisite is to have basic knowledge on JavaScript.
## Step 1:
1. Create a react project using: npm create vite@latest name-of-your-project -- --template react
2. Then go to that project path and install npm packages: npm i
3. After that open that project on VsCode

## Step 2:
1. Run the project using terminal: npm run dev
