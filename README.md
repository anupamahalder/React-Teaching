# React Teaching
  I will cover the core concepts of React from the begining. The only prerequisite is to have basic knowledge on JavaScript.
## Step 1:
1. Create a react project using: npm create vite@latest name-of-your-project -- --template react
2. Then go to that project path and install npm packages: npm i
3. After that open that project on VsCode

## Step 2:
1. Run the project using terminal: npm run dev 

## Step 3:
### useState(): 
useState() is a React hook that returns an array with exactly two values:
1. The current state. During the first render, it will match the initialState you have passed.
2. The set function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.
